//Application to discover the k-hop neighbors for k from 1 to n-1 where n is the number of processes in the system.

/*Payload message type details:
	message =
*/

//Write a distributed program that uses the Node class you developed as part of the previous
// project and allows every process in a distributed system to discover its k-hop neighbors
// for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n âˆ’ 1, where n denotes the number of processes in the system.

/*
all processes execute round 1 at time t0
              execute round 2 at time t1 ...

during each round each process will send message to its neighbors
                  each process will receive messages from its neighbors
                  each process will be in state s_p^x where x is the time and p is the process #
                  process the messages sent by neighbors
                    messages will contain tag of the round # it was sent during and (?) 1 hop neighbors
                    what information to piggyback
//                    if done correctly, you will get your k hop neighbors on round k
                  buffer messages that are from a future round (only +1 rounds), discard old round messages
                  when done discovering new nodes, then you are done
